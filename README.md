*DESCRIPTION* 

This project demonstrates the practical use of API integration and data visualization in Python by connecting to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and visually represent it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to build a Python script that allows users to input a city name and retrieve current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The OpenWeatherMap API is used because of its ease of access and detailed global weather coverage. To interact with the API, the requests library is used to send HTTP GET requests and handle the JSON response efficiently.
Once the data is retrieved, it is cleaned and structured using Pandas, making it easy to extract meaningful insights. Visualization plays a key role in helping users understand the weather patterns. The data is plotted using Matplotlib to generate bar graphs and Seaborn for enhanced aesthetic plots like heatmaps or line charts. For instance, temperature variation across multiple cities can be plotted to analyze geographic differences or detect trends in real-time. This project is a great example of combining backend data acquisition (via APIs) with frontend presentation (via plots), which is a crucial skill in data analysis and dashboard development. Additionally, it highlights how external data sources can be integrated into Python applications to produce informative visuals that are both interactive and dynamic.

In summary, this project covers:

Fetching data from a live API (OpenWeatherMap)

Parsing and organizing JSON data using Python

Visualizing weather attributes using Matplotlib and Seaborn

It serves as a strong foundation for students and professionals looking to build real-time dashboards, automated reporting tools, or analytics platforms involving third-party data integration.
